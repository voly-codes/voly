# Pipeline — Backend Reference

`voly/pipeline/core.py:Pipeline` — orchestrator for **text-only** tasks (inference via AIGateway).
For tasks that write files — use `AgentRunner` + executor.

---

## When Pipeline, when AgentRunner

| Scenario | What to use |
|---|---|
| Question / summarization / review without edits | Pipeline → AIGateway.chat() |
| Write/change files in a project | AgentRunner → executor (claude-code / wrangler / zen) |
| Web UI task with code | smart dispatch: pipeline → claude-code automatically |
| CLI `voly run --executor cursor` | AgentRunner directly |

---

## Pipeline stages

```
INIT
  ↓ REPO_INTELLIGENCE — optional: analyze external repo when repo_url set
  ↓ AGUI_START        — notify AG-UI of task start (SSE events)
  ↓ A2A_DISCOVER      — find external agents (A2A federation)
  ↓ A2A_DELEGATE      — delegate subtasks if needed
  ↓ ROUTE             — AgentRouter.analyze_task() + route()
  ↓ MEMORY_RETRIEVE   — MemoryStore.search() — relevant context
  ↓ RTK_FILTER        — RTK token filtering of context
  ↓ SKILL_SUGGEST     — non-blocking: query CF marketplace for missing skills
  ↓ SKILL_INJECT      — inject system prompt from Catalog Skills
  ↓ HEADROOM_COMPRESS — Headroom: compress messages if > token limit
  ↓ DSPY_PROGRAM_CALL — optional: DSPyRunner.run() (shadow or active)
  ↓ MODEL_CALL        — AIGateway.chat() → response
  ↓ MEMORY_STORE      — save (task, response) to memory
  ↓ AGUI_DONE         — close AG-UI stream
  ↓ DONE / ERROR
  ↓ emit TaskEvent → telemetry
```

## REPO_INTELLIGENCE stage

Runs **after** `INIT` and **before** `A2A_DISCOVER` when `repo_url` is a non-empty
string (via `Pipeline.run(repo_url=…)` or `context["repo_url"]`).

On success:

| Context key | Content |
|---|---|
| `repo_intelligence` | `RepositoryIntelligence` from `voly.intelligence.analyze()` |
| `task_features` | `intel.stack.languages + intel.stack.frameworks` |

On failure: logs a warning, sets `repo_intelligence` to `None` and `task_features`
to `[]`. The pipeline continues — this stage never blocks downstream work.

Stage order: `INIT → REPO_INTELLIGENCE → AGUI_START → A2A_DISCOVER → …`

---

## Auto multi-agent (A2A)

After `ROUTE`, the pipeline checks `_should_dispatch_a2a(analysis)`. If A2A is enabled
and the task is complex/multi-component (≥ `a2a.min_flags_for_dispatch` flags from
`requires_code_gen/review/testing/deployment`, or `complexity == "high"`), the task
goes to the multi-agent path `_stage_a2a_auto` instead of a single `MODEL_CALL`.

**`a2a.execution_mode` (default `"local"`):**

- **`local`** — `_run_multiagent_local`:
  1. `TaskDecomposer` splits the task into roles (architect → developer → tester →
     reviewer → devops) with dependencies.
  2. **Lead orchestrator** (`a2a/lead.py::LeadOrchestrator`, re-exported from `multiagent.py`) — a strong model
     (premium tier or `a2a.lead_model`) evaluates the task and assigns each role a
     **model tier** (`premium|standard|cheap`) and **skills** (from the registry). On LLM-lead
     failure — deterministic fallback (`_ROLE_TIER` + top skills for the role).
  3. Tier → concrete (model, provider) via `resolve_tier_model()`: real pool
     `_PROVIDER_MODELS`, filtered by `ProviderHealthChecker`
     (premium = anthropic/cloudflare-dynamic/deepseek/opencode/mimo;
     weak = workers-ai/deepseek/opencode-zen/mimo/omniroute).
     After auth/billing errors in `run_local`, the failing provider is marked
     unhealthy for the rest of the process. `VOLY_A2A_EXCLUDE_PROVIDERS` is also
     applied **before the first chat call** (`apply_env_provider_exclusions`) so
     an assigned but excluded provider (e.g. Anthropic out of credits) does not
     burn one doomed attempt per role.
  4. `run_local` runs roles in dependency order. With hybrid + `cwd`, implement
     roles use **AgentRunner** (file-capable); architect/reviewer stay on
     `AIGateway.chat()`. Roles whose dependencies are all satisfied share a
     **wave** (`a2a.parallel_waves`, default on): the wave's **chat** calls run
     concurrently (cap: `a2a.max_parallel_roles`); **executor** roles always run
     serially (shared cwd/git, `.voly/executor.lock`). Prompt building, memory,
     plan-gate transitions, and telemetry stay on the caller thread. A spend
     limit stops scheduling further waves.
     **Executor honesty:** on a code-gen task, an executor role that reports
     success but leaves `files_touched` empty (no git delta either) is marked
     failed — a plausible text summary without file changes is not an
     implementation, so downstream roles degrade and the run reports `partial`.
     Each assignment also records `duration_ms` (chat/executor wall-clock) in
     `a2a_assignments` telemetry.
  5. Merge → `TaskEvent` with `a2a_dispatched=True`, `a2a_agents_used`,
     `a2a_assignments` (role/tier/model/skills/tokens/cost).
     **Outcome status:** `completed` only when all active roles succeed;
     `partial` when implement roles fail but earlier roles produced output;
     `failed` when nothing succeeded. `PipelineResult.success` is true only
     for `completed`.

**Architect / implement policy:** architect chat is plan-only (no full code
dumps, `a2a.architect_max_tokens` default **4096**); developer/tester prompts
enforce ≤300 lines per file (≤500 only when architect explicitly allows in the
plan). Prior-role context is compact (files list + truncated body, default
~1400 chars); reviewer/tester also get a git-diff evidence block from prior
`files_touched`.

- **`federation`** — sub-tasks go to remote agents (`a2a.federation_url`)
  via `dispatch_parallel` (legacy path).

**Web promote:** `/api/run` with `executor=pipeline` for a complex task is no longer
promoted to `claude-code` — `_would_dispatch_a2a()` keeps it in the pipeline.
Simple code tasks (1 flag) still go to the `claude-code` executor.

**Pre-run gates on the web path** (`voly/web/routes/run.py`, see
`docs/backend/api.md`): the UI runs a skill-suggest gate and a **tech stack
gate** (`POST /api/tech/detect`, fallback `GET /api/tech/categories`) before
`POST /api/run`; a confirmed `tech_stack` is prepended to the task as a version
constraint block (`voly/catalog/tech_registry.py:tech_stack_context`). A
non-existent `cwd` is greenfield-scaffolded (dir + `git init` + stack-aware
`.gitignore` + initial commit). When `reuse.auto: true`, both the web `/api/run`
path and `Pipeline.run` (CLI `voly run --cwd …`) call `auto_reuse()` before
routing / A2A so `.voly/reuse/reports/` exists for architect context inject.

### Hybrid multi-agent (implement roles → files) — PR1 skeleton

Design: [`docs/proposals/hybrid-multiagent-executor.md`](../proposals/hybrid-multiagent-executor.md).

When `a2a.hybrid_code_gen` is true **and** a project `cwd` is available
(`default_cwd` / `VOLY_PROJECT_CWD`), each sub-agent role resolves to
`mode=chat` or `mode=executor` via `voly/a2a/hybrid.py`:

| Role | Default mode |
|---|---|
| architect, reviewer | `chat` → `AIGateway.chat()` |
| developer, bugfixer, tester (code-gen), devops | `executor` → AgentRunner (file-capable) |
| tester without `requires_code_gen` | `chat` (`tester_text_only`) |

Per-role **chat providers** are spread across the healthy tier pool via
`resolve_role_model()`. On gateway error, chat roles retry the next healthy
provider in the tier (`chat_with_provider_fallback`). Anthropic is last in
strong/standard tier pools so credit-balance errors do not burn the first
attempt of every role.

Per-role **executors** (`resolve_role_executor`): developer / tester / devops →
`cursor`, bugfixer → `deepseek` (override:
`VOLY_A2A_EXECUTOR_<ROLE>`). Lead may set `execution: executor` for any role in
`EXECUTOR_CAPABLE_ROLES` (developer, bugfixer, tester, devops); architect /
reviewer / security stay chat.

Config (`voly.yaml` → `a2a`):

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `hybrid_code_gen` | `true` | Master switch (`VOLY_A2A_HYBRID` env override) |
| `hybrid_require_cwd` | `true` | Without cwd, all roles stay chat |
| `executor_default` | `claude-code` | Fallback when role has no mapped executor |
| `executor_roles` | developer, bugfixer, tester, devops | Roles that prefer executor mode (empty → this built-in set) |
| `architect_max_tokens` | `4096` | Chat budget for architect (plan-only) |

**PR1:** mode map + `run_local` branch + injectable `executor_runner`.

**PR2 (current):** when hybrid is active and `cwd` is set, the pipeline injects
`make_agent_runner_executor(config)` so implement roles call **AgentRunner** with
the billing fallback chain (`claude-code → cursor → deepseek → wrangler →
opencode → zen`). Sub-role
runs use `emit_event=False` so the parent multi-agent `TaskEvent` stays primary;
per-role cost/files land on `Assignment` (`files_touched`, `executor`, `cost_usd`).
On executor failure/timeout, `files_touched` falls back to a git porcelain diff
when the runner did not report files. Empty greenfield `cwd` gets `git init`
before hybrid so tracking works on the first pass.

Without `cwd`, hybrid stays chat-only. Without a runner (tests can still inject
mocks), executor-mode roles fall back to chat with `chat_fallback_no_runner`.

The lead orchestrator may override the mode per role via an optional
`execution: "chat" | "executor"` field in its JSON plan (validated in
`_parse_plan`; invalid or missing values fall back to the role map,
`mode_reason=lead_override` when applied). Prior sub-agent output is injected
into dependent prompts truncated **and labeled as untrusted context** (data,
not instructions) — see `TaskDecomposer.inject_prior_context`.

Executors never run without an explicit project `cwd`, even when
`hybrid_require_cwd: false` — such roles are forced to chat with
`mode_reason=no_cwd`, and `run_local` logs a `hybrid_skipped_no_cwd` warning.

### Cascade on prior-role failure

When a dependency role fails (`skip_dependents_on_failure`, default on):

| Dependent role | Policy |
|---|---|
| post-impl role + code-gen + **no code** from any executor | **early skip** (`skipped_no_code`) — including soft-fail with empty `files_touched` |
| executor dependent with usable prior code (`ok` **or** non-`.voly/` `files_touched`) | **continues** (soft safety: protected-path rollback that left other files) |
| executor dependent with no usable prior | **hard skip** (`skipped_prior_failed`) |
| chat with ≥1 successful prior | **degraded run** on surviving context (`…+degraded_prior_failed`) |
| any role with **all** priors failed and no usable code | hard skip |

Soft safety in `AgentRunner`: protected-path rollback that leaves other files
keeps `success=True` (`safety_soft`) so the multi-agent chain does not
cascade-skip tester/reviewer/devops after a useful greenfield write.

So a failed developer no longer skips the whole chain when files exist:
`_all_flags` also wires tester/reviewer/devops to depend on **architect**, so
they can still act on the plan and the run reports `partial` instead of
`failed` when implementation is missing.

**PR3:** request `cwd` is passed through `pipeline.run(context={"cwd": …})` so
hybrid file writes target the UI/API project path, not only `default_cwd`.
SSE `start` carries `a2a` / `hybrid` / `cwd` (plus
`hybrid_warning: "hybrid_skipped_no_cwd"` when hybrid is on but no `cwd`
resolved); `done` includes a `hybrid` summary and assignments with
`mode` / `executor` / `files_touched`. Web UI multi-agent panels show mode and
file badges.

## Multi-agent resilience (Rung A: heartbeat + watchdog)

`TaskEvent` is emitted only at the **end** of a run, so a hung/crashed
multi-agent chain leaves no trace and the watchdog cannot see it. Rung A
(`voly/runtime/runs.py`) adds a lightweight in-flight record:

- `run_local` writes a `RunRecord` to `telemetry.runs_dir` (`.voly/runs/<task_id>.json`)
  at start and updates the **heartbeat after each sub-agent** (`current_role`,
  `done_roles`, `heartbeat_at`). At the end — `status = completed | failed`.
- `Watchdog` treats a run as **stale** if the heartbeat is older than
  `watchdog_stale_factor × a2a.task_timeout_seconds` (default 2 × 120s).
  A crashed process leaves a `running` record with a stale heartbeat → the
  watchdog picks it up.
- Tracking is **best-effort**: any write errors are swallowed and do not break the run
  (like telemetry). Writes are atomic (`tempfile` + `os.replace`).

CLI:

```bash
voly runs list                 # all runs (status/progress/age/role)
voly runs show <task_id>       # details of one run
voly runs reap [--yes]         # find (and mark) runs without heartbeat
```

The records also provide empirical data for roadmap §6 — real chain lengths and hang
frequency — to decide whether more expensive rungs (checkpoint/resume) are needed.

### Plan gates on multi-agent (Rung B PR4)

When `plan.enabled=true` and `plan.mode` is `shadow` or `active` and
`plan.a2a_attach=true`, `_run_multiagent_local` → `run_local` mirrors each role
as a plan step (see `voly/plan/bridge.py`):

- Dependents start only after prior steps are **verified** (not just `ok`).
- `active`: failed acceptance stops the role (`ok=False`); dependents skip.
- `shadow`: failed acceptance is logged; step is soft-verified so the chain continues.
- Defaults: chat roles get `output_nonempty`; executor roles always get
  `file_line_limit` (300 lines, or 500 only with strict architect approval);
  optional `executor_require_git_diff`, `tester_command`.
- Telemetry: `Assignment.plan_status` / `plan_verify_ok` in `a2a_assignments`;
  `RunRecord.plan_id` + `step_statuses` (CLI: `voly runs show`).

## PipelineResult

```python
@dataclass
class PipelineResult:
    success: bool
    stage: PipelineStage
    duration_ms: float
    response: GatewayResponse | None
    route: RouteDecision | None
    error: str | None
    injected_skills: list[str]
    tokens_saved_by_rtk: int
    tokens_saved_by_headroom: int
    dspy_used: bool
    dspy_mode: str
    a2a_tasks: list[A2ATask]
```

## Agent Router

`voly/router.py:AgentRouter`

```python
analysis = router.analyze_task(task)
# analysis.requires_code_gen — True if the task requires file changes
# analysis.task_type         — "code_generation" | "review" | "question" | ...

route = router.route(analysis)
# route.agent    — "developer" | "reviewer" | "architect" | ...
# route.model    — concrete model
# route.provider — "anthropic" | "openai" | ...
```

`requires_code_gen = True` when the task contains keywords: implement, create, build,
add, write, fix, refactor, migrate, напиши, создай, добавь, реализуй, исправь, ...

This is used in `web/routes/run.py` for smart dispatch.

---

## Lazy skill suggestion (SKILL_SUGGEST stage)

`voly/pipeline/stages_context.py::_stage_skill_suggest()` — runs between `RTK_FILTER`
and `SKILL_INJECT` on the single-model path, and at the start of local multi-agent
(`_run_multiagent_local` in `stages_a2a.py`) so A2A runs also return `skill_suggestions`.

Queries the CF marketplace for skills relevant to the task that are not installed
locally, then emits a `SKILL_SUGGEST` stage event. The UI receives the suggestions
list in the `done` SSE payload (`skill_suggestions`) and shows an install banner.

**Pre-run skill gate (Web UI):** before `POST /api/run`, `RunPanel` calls
`GET /api/marketplace/skills/suggest?task=…`. If suggestions exist, a modal lets
the user install skills (and wait until install finishes) before starting the
task, or skip and run immediately.

**SkillScout** (`voly/registry/scout.py`): wraps `MarketplaceClient.search()`
and filters the results against the local `SkillRegistry` index. Long task
prompts are truncated to ~240 characters for FTS. Suggestions must share at
least one task keyword with the skill's name/description/tags (loose FTS hits
are dropped). Returns slim dicts
`{id, name, description, repository, install_kind, tags}`.

**Relevance scoring (SKILL_INJECT / A2A skills):**
`match_skills_for_task` (`voly/pipeline/skills.py`) scores every candidate
against the task keywords, agent, and project stack; skills below the
threshold are not injected. Installed marketplace/org skills are **no longer
unconditionally included** — they need a task-keyword or language/framework
match. PROJECT-source skills (generated from this repo's docs) are always
kept; curated builtins may qualify on agent compatibility alone. The lead
orchestrator respects an explicit empty `skills` choice from the lead model —
the top-2 candidate fallback applies only when the lead call itself failed.

**Index skills are never injected.** A skill flagged `is_index: true` in its
YAML (a table-of-contents skill that lists other skills but carries no
executable expertise, e.g. `engineering-skills`) scores `0.0` in
`_score_skill`. The flag is loaded by `voly/registry/loader.py` /
`registry/skills.py` (`Skill.is_index`); additionally the hardcoded ID
blocklist `_KNOWN_INDEX_SKILL_IDS` in `voly/pipeline/skills.py` keeps such
skills blocked even after a catalog resync drops the flag.

**Design invariants:**
- Always non-blocking: any marketplace error is swallowed; the pipeline proceeds.
- Skipped when `registry.marketplace_url` is not configured.
- `install_kind='git'` skills are installed via `git clone --depth 1` into
  `.voly/skills/<id>/`; `external_catalog.py` picks up the `SKILL.md` on the
  next `voly catalog sync`.
- `install_kind='single'` (default) — existing flat-YAML behaviour.

**API endpoints:**
- `GET /api/marketplace/skills/suggest?task=<text>` — direct query for UI polling / pre-run gate.
- `POST /api/marketplace/skills/{skill_id}/install` — trigger install (existing).

## Stage module layout

`Pipeline` composes `_PipelineStageMixin` (`stages.py`) from focused mixins
(behaviour split for maintainability only — public API unchanged):

| Module | Contents |
|---|---|
| `stages_a2a.py` | AG-UI + A2A federation / `_run_multiagent_local` |
| `stages_route.py` | `_stage_route`, `_stage_spend_check` |
| `stages_context.py` | memory, Headroom, RTK, skill suggest/inject |
| `stages_emit.py` | builders, gateway error checks, TaskEvent emit |
| `stages.py` | composes mixins into `_PipelineStageMixin` |

Import path `from voly.pipeline.stages import _PipelineStageMixin` remains stable.

---

## Changing the Pipeline

Rules:
- Preserve the `PipelineResult` structure
- Each stage is a named `_stage_*` method (see module layout above)
- Always `emit TaskEvent` to telemetry
- No product-specific logic in `voly/`
- When changing — update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and this file
